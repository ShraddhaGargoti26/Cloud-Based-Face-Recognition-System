# Cloud-Based-Face-Recognition-System
A cloud-based face recognition system using AWS leverages Amazon Rekognition for accurate facial analysis, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and AWS S3 for storage. This system can detect, recognize, and compare faces in images or videos, making it ideal for applications like security, access control, and social media tagging.
